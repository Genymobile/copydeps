Contributions are welcome!

To submit a patch, first make sure your Python code follows [PEP 8][PEP8].

You can check with the following command:

    flake8 --filename '*' --ignore E501 copydeps

(We ignore E501, line length because the code contains output of commands)

Then file a [pull request][PR] against the master branch.
